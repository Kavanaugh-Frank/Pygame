# Pygame
Made with the Python Libray Pygame this holds various tests that I have done using the Pygame library.

Examples include sand.py which is a falling sand particle simulator, and combo_project.py which is a rotating wireframe of a cube/triangle either using or not using weak prospective projection onto the points

Controls for Sand.py: Arrow keys to move the sand spawn left and right and the up arrow to start/stop the spawning of sand
Controsl for combo_project.py: S to start rotation, W to switch between Cube/Square and Pyramid/Triangle, SpaceBar to switch to and from weak prospective projection
